## stats.json counts

The first item is a count of regression commands in all files. Given two commands:

    svy: reg ...
    reg ...

the count will be:

    svy:reg = 1
    reg = 1

The remaining items (counts per file) count prefix and "command" (regression or otherwise) separately.
