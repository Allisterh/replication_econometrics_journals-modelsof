/* Note: The files below produce excel files with the number of jobs accounted for by
financial constraints. To compute the share shown in the paper, this has to be devided by 
the decline in employment in the respective category from the aggregate statistics computed by 
SAS file summary_stats.sas. Note: For the KFS share I use only the fraction of employment for which I 
have KFS data. */
