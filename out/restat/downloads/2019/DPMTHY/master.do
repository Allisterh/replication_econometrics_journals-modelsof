*** MAIN RESULTS (Primary Tables and Figures): ***

* Table 1: This do-file generates the results that make up Table 1 (as well as the results in Tables 7, 8 and 9 of Appendix C):
do "$dir/2_main_text_figures_tables/table_1/code/1_generate_taus_main.do"

* Table 2: This do-file generates the results that make up Table 2:
do "$dir/2_main_text_figures_tables/table_2/code/1_generate_Taus_IDA_100.do"

* Table 3: This do-file generates the results that make up Table 3:
do "$dir/2_main_text_figures_tables/table_3/code/1_generate_taus_social_group.do"

* Tables 4 and 5: This do-file generates Tables 4 and 5:
do "$dir/2_main_text_figures_tables/tables_4_and_5/code/1_state_Level_Regressions_main.do"

* Figure 1:
* Note: to generate Figure 1, run "figure_1.R", in "replication/2_main_text_figures_tables/figures/code/"

* Figure 2:
do "$dir/2_main_text_figures_tables/figures/code/figure_2.do"


*** SECONDARY RESULTS (Statements referred to in text): ***

* 1: Generate "naive" estimate of tau:
do "$dir/3_statements_from_text/code/1_without_misreporting.do"

* 2: Generate tau for 1998 EC:
do "$dir/3_statements_from_text/code/2_1998_results.do"

* 3: Generate tau at the 50 worker threshold:
do "$dir/3_statements_from_text/code/3_generate_tau_IDA_50.do"


*** ADDITONAL RESULTS (Tables and Figures in the Appendices): ***

* Appendix C:
* Note: Tables 7, 8 and 9 of Appendix C are generated by the do file "1_generate_taus_main.do" (called above)


* Appendix D: 
* This do-file generates Table 10 of Appendix D: 
do  "$dir/4_appendix_figures_tables/code/robustness_to_n_L.do"


* Appendix E: 
* Note: Tables 11, 12 and 13 - as well as Figures 3 and 4 - of Appendix E, are generated by the do file ""1_state_level_regressions_main.do" (called above)
* This do-file generates Table 14 of Appendix E:
do  "$dir/4_appendix_figures_tables/code/state_x_ind_WB_level_regressions.do"


* Appendix F: 
* Note: Table 15 of Appendix F is generated by the do file ""1_state_level_regressions_main.do" (called above)
