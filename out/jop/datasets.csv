Replication Data for: Projecting confidence: How the probabilistic horserace confuses and demobilizes the public,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TRIEF2,"May 1, 2019","Recent years have seen a dramatic change in horserace coverage of elections in the U.S.---shifting focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that emphasize candidates' chance of victory. Could this shift in the political information environment affect election outcomes? We use experiments to show that forecasting increases certainty about an election's outcome, confuses many, and decreases turnout. Furthermore, we show that election forecasting has become prominent in the media, particularly in outlets with liberal audiences, and show that such coverage tends to more strongly affect the candidate who is ahead---raising questions about whether they contributed to Trump's victory over Clinton in 2016. We bring empirical evidence to this question, using ANES data to show that Democrats and Independents expressed unusual confidence in a decisive 2016 election outcome---and that the same measure of confidence is associated with lower reported turnout.",

Replication Data for: From Political Mobilization to Electoral Participation:Turnout in Barcelona in the 1930s,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/C8DCCW,"May 1, 2019","This article examines the process of electoral mobilization that follows the extension of voting rights to low-income citizens. We take advantage of a historically unique panel data set of official registers that include individual voting roll-calls as well as individual demographics of almost 25,000 electors in Barcelona in the 1930s, matched with relevant precinct-level socio-economic, political and geographical data. We show that voting was driven by the direct mobilization strategies developed by political parties and by those social organizations, such as trade unions, that encompassed an important part of society. This was the case especially among unskilled workers and in areas with a high density of working class voters. We also show that turnout was shaped by indirect channels, such as the social networks in which partisan ideas and organizations were embedded. To identify the mobilizational effects of organizations we rely on a variety of strategies, including a sharp, short-term change in anarchist trade union's electoral strategies. (2019-04-19)",

Replication Data for: Police Violence and Public Perceptions:  An Experimental Study of How Information and Endorsements Affect Support for Law Enforcement,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/V83FXD,"Mar 20, 2019","Incidents of police violence can undermine trust in legal authorities. Whether such incidents have this effect will depend on how citizens evaluate victims, the police, and public officials. Citizens’ evaluations may be shaped by information about: 1) a pattern of police violence and 2) government responses. We study citizens’ reactions to police violence by randomly assigning these two types of information in the context of the Stephon Clark shooting in Sacramento. We find that information influences levels of blame for and trust in the police, but the effects depend on citizens’ race and whether they live in the community where the violence occurred. In contrast, information does not alter citizens’ perceptions of local police officer organizations and, in turn, their willingness to follow police endorsements in elections. These results suggest a catch-22 whereby police violence can diminish the standing of police personnel, but favorable local opinion preserves their political influence.","police violence, endorsement, trust, blame attribution, local elections"

We argue that voting along class lines is more likely to occur where states can tax the income and assets of the wealthy. In low bureaucratic capacity states, the rich are less likely to participate in electoral politics because they have less to fear from redistributive policy. When wealthy citizens abstain from voting, politicians face a more impoverished electorate. Because politicians cannot credibly campaign on anti-tax platforms, they are less likely to emphasize redistribution and partisan preferences are less likely to diverge across income groups. Using cross-national survey data, we show there is more class voting in countries with greater bureaucratic capacity. We also show that class voting and fiscal capacity were correlated in the United States in the mid-1930s when state-level revenue collection and party systems were less dependent on national economic policy.","Class Voting, Redistributive Politics, State Capacity, American Political Behavior, Comparative Political Behavior"

Yet there has been almost no previous research on the policy effects of the partisan composition of county governments. Most counties in the United States have small legislatures, usually called commissions or councils, that set their budgets and other policies. In this study, we examine whether counties with Democratic legislators spend more than counties with Republican ones. We assemble an original dataset of 10,708 elections in approximately 298 medium and large counties over the past 25 years. Based on a regression discontinuity design, we find that electing a Democratic legislator rather than a Republican one leads the average county to increase spending by about 5%. Overall, our findings contribute to a growing literature on the policy consequences of partisan control of state and local government. They show that the partisan selection of county legislators has important policy effects in county governments.","local politics, representation, elections"

As violence of various forms -- from war to terrorism -- is becoming more frequent even in the developed world, understanding its political consequences is a pressing concern. We argue that violence makes citizens view politics as more combative and aggressive. Because the traits that align with these perceptions (e.g., dominance, aggressiveness, decisiveness) are associated more with masculinity than femininity, we hypothesize that violence increases engagement among men while reducing it among women. To test our argument, we conduct an experiment in Bosnia (N=1,125), the site of a major ethnic civil war in 1992-1995. The evidence confirms that past violence, when made salient, leads women to express significantly less and men significantly more desire to engage in politics. We conclude from these findings that violent conflict can introduce disparities in political engagement across gender, underscoring a significant challenge policymakers face in post-conflict societies.","political engagement, gender, violence, post-conflict, Eastern Europe"

However, framing theory suggests that source credibility is a prerequisite for such frames to be effective. Relying on an experiment embedded in a multi-wave, nationally representative sample of Americans, we examine whether public attacks on the judiciary—by either Trump or distinguished law professors—affect the U.S. Supreme Court's legitimacy. We demonstrate that criticisms of the Court from either source are only deleterious among respondents who believe the source is credible; source credibility also shapes agreement with the criticism. Because President Trump is viewed with distrust by a majority of Americans, his comments pose only a limited threat to the Court's legitimacy. However, our data also suggest that a more credible source (inside or outside government), using similar attacks, could do considerable damage to the legitimacy of the American government's most fragile branch.

Countering Capture: Elite Networks and Government Responsiveness in China's Land Market Reform,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/GS8IFM,"Aug 13, 2018","Government responsiveness is often viewed as a result of political pressure from the public, but why do politicians facing similar pressure sometimes differ in their responsiveness? This article considers the configurations of elite networks as a key mediating factor. We argue that access to external support networks helps improve politicians' responsiveness to ordinary citizens by reducing their dependence on vested interests, and test this claim using China's land market reform as a case. Leveraging novel city-level measures of mass grievances and political networks, we demonstrate that the intensity of land-related grievances is positively associated with reform occurrence, but this association is only salient among a subset of city leaders with informal connections to the higher-level authority. We also show that connected leaders tend to implement policies less congruent with local bureaucratic and business interests. These findings underscore the importance of intra-elite dynamics in shaping mass-elite interactions. (2018-08-07)",

Abstract: Voters frequently use demographic characteristics such as race or gender as shortcuts when evaluating politicians. We use two survey experiments to show that a candidate’s gender identity (specifically whether they identify as the same gender as the sex they were assigned at birth) functions as a similar cue. When a news story identified a candidate as transgender, respondents rated them as more liberal and less likely to represent them, and less likely to receive their vote. The overall electoral penalty is moderated by voters’ party, ideology, religiosity, and authoritarianism. In contrast to research on other demographic cues, we find that these effects persist even in the presence of cues about the candidate’s party, suggesting that voters infer substantial information from politicians’ gender identity.",

While existing research specifies a direct effect of rugged terrain on civil war, i.e., it impedes state efforts to counter rebellion, we argue that terrain has an overlooked indirect effect on civil war via its historical influence on the distribution and political status of ethnic groups. We argue that access to variable rugged terrain facilitated the development and survival of more distinct ethnic groups by both restricting interaction among communities in rugged areas, and complicating state repression. Both arguments suggest that groups in rugged areas face greater risk of political marginalization. Using geo-coded data on civil war, terrain and the distribution and political status of ethnic groups, we demonstrate that up to 40% of rugged terrain’s effects on civil war are mediated by its indirect effect on the exclusion of politically relevant ethnic groups.

While political scientists have traditionally described the parties national committees as inconsequential but impartial service providers, scholars have also long argued that incumbent presidents have considerable control over their party’s national committee. In this paper, I explore the nature of presidential power over the party-in-organization, and whether Trump can take advantage of his control over the Republican National Committee. I show that presidential domination over the party-in-organization is based on the president’s ability to nominate and replace the national committee’s chair, and that presidents have used this power to push their committees to promote both their preferred policy positions and themselves. I argue this means Trump has the ability to use the RNC to promote the GOP as ‘his’ party – including during a potential primary challenge for his re-nomination in 2020.","DNC, RNC, American presidency"

Recent studies have argued that predictable corruption, in which bribers are guaranteed the delivery of government services, is less distortionary and more efficiency-enhancing than arbitrary corruption in which officials engage in simple plunder. Yet, the empirical evidence is mixed. Leveraging a vignette experiment embedded in an original firm survey in China, we find that overseas investors always consider corruption detrimental. There is some evidence that high-productivity and fixed-asset intensive investors might view predictable corruption more favorably than arbitrary corruption. Additionally, we find that compared to arbitrary corruption, predictable corruption is not associated with a significantly higher probability of market entry, but it increases the likelihood of majority ownership. Overall, the results provide little evidence that corruption ""greases the wheels of commerce"" even in a most likely case, and suggest that the perceived benefits of predictable corruption are limited.","Corruption, Uncertainty, Foreign Investment, Survey Experiment, China"

We show experimentally that casual interethnic contact in a post-conflict society can increase ethnic bias. Day laborers in Kabul, Afghanistan, were equally altruistic toward their in-group and their out-group when out-group members were not physically present. When out-group members were physically present in an environment where no guidance for interaction or explicit incentives for cooperation were given, out-group altruism was decreasing in time among those who did not speak the out-group’s language, suggesting that this contact highlights differences in descent-based attributes and increases in-group identification. We provide evidence for a psychological mechanism leading to in-group bias in casual, everyday interactions in a post-conflict society, with implications for studying the nature of ethnic bias in political and economic behavior. Results suggest that interethnic interaction does not automatically improve ethnic relationships, and attention should be paid to the conditions under which interaction occurs. (2018-05-07)",

Donation-based measures are powerful predictors of policy preferences for a wide range of issues and successfully discriminate between donors from the same party. The overall predictive accuracy and relative improvement over party are comparable to what is achieved by scaling roll call votes in legislatures. The results add to an existing body of evidence on the internal validity and reliability of donation-based measures.

This paper proposes a way to evaluate the electoral impact of vote buying by using data from the 2012 presidential election in Mexico, where one of the parties distributed gift cards in exchange for support on Election Day. I evaluate the effect on citizens’ electoral behavior by considering voters’ proximity to the closest store where they could redeem the cards. The empirical analysis provides evidence of a persuasive effect of the gift cards, whose magnitude was positively related to precincts’ proximity to the store. The analysis also shows the local scope of this vote-buying incident on the electoral outcome, whose effect was focused on a defined group of voters. This study expands on recent theoretical accounts of parties’ targeting strategies and addresses some potential limitations in measuring the electoral consequences of vote buying.",

Replication Data for: Patronage Appointments and Agency Independence,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VHNONI,"Mar 27, 2018","When making appointments to bureaucratic positions, Presidents often have to balance various appointee traits, including loyalty, competence, connections, campaign experience, and potential electoral benefit. Previous research has suggested that patronage appointees---often characterized as those individuals appointed because of campaign experience, electoral benefit, or other non-policy political benefits---tend to be placed in low-priority agencies whose missions are ideological matches to the President and in positions where they will have minimal effects on agency outcomes. However, this research has overlooked the role of agency structure and the ease with which appointees can be placed into---or removed from---office. This article focuses on agency decisionmaker independence, or the extent to which agency structure limits the appointment/removal of key agency decision makers. Using data on individuals appointed in the first six months of the Obama administration, I find that Presidents put fewer patronage appointees into agencies whose structural features promote agency decisionmaker independence.

While scholars have explored the consequences of partisan media for political attitudes and behaviors, little work has looked at how variations in incivility moderate partisan media’s effects. Using a population-based survey experiment, we show that incivility affectively de¬polarizes partisans when it comes from an in-party source (e.g., MSNBC for Democrats, Fox News for Republicans). Incivility on out-party sources affectively polarizes the audience, however, and we show that the respondent’s degree of conflict aversion conditions these effects. Our results raise intriguing normative questions about the tradeoffs between polarization and incivility, and highlight how scholars must account for both levels of incivility and partisan slant when studying the effects of partisan media.

Distinguishing between (a) non-election periods in autocracies that do not hold competitive elections; (b) election periods in autocracies that hold regular elections; and (c) non-election periods in such autocracies, I argue that bad economic performance makes authoritarian regimes especially likely to break down in election years, but the anticipation of competitive elections should dissuade citizens and elites from engaging in anti-regime behavior in non-election periods, facilitating short-term survival. Thus, compared to regimes that do not hold competitive elections, electoral autocracies should be more vulnerable to bad economic performance in election periods but more resilient to it in non-election years. A study of 258 authoritarian regimes between 1948 and 2011 confirms these expectations. The effect is driven by competitive elections determining the composition of the executive office, and elections-related breakdowns are more likely to result in democratization.","authoritarian regimes, authoritarian elections, economic performance, regime breakdown"

While previous research on political behavior has explored the influence of collective economic conditions, self-interested explanations have heavily swayed work on policy preferences. We bridge these two previously distinct literatures to articulate a theory of public policy preferences that highlights when both common and pocketbook factors influence preferences for social insurance. Using a cross-national sample of developed democracies from 1996 and 2006, we conclude that when personal economic conditions are dire, the pull of self interest trumps both collective and policy concerns.

Receiving less attention has been whether such institutions also increase satisfaction by providing more inclusive political discourse. Citizens may value having their voice represented in politics, independent of authority. This paper presents the first micro-level evidence of this mechanism by having subjects experience a simulated election campaign that manipulates both the outcome and the discussion of a policy issue that they cared about. The results show that subjects were less satisfied with democracy when they lost the election, but that this gap disappeared when ‘losers’ had been exposed to discussion of an issue they felt was important. This suggests that institutions and party systems with more diverse voices may cushion the blow of losing by producing more inclusive discourse.",satisfaction with democracy; electoral systems; political discourse; representation

A common government strategy to deter discrimination is to publicize the law and communicate potential penalties for violations. We study this strategy by coupling an audit experiment with a randomized intervention involving nearly 700 landlords in New York City and report the first causal estimates of the effect on rental discrimination against Blacks and Hispanics of a targeted government messaging campaign. We uncover discrimination levels higher than prior estimates indicate, especially against Hispanics, who are approximately six percentage points less likely to receive callbacks and offers than whites. We find suggestive evidence that government messaging can reduce discrimination against Hispanics, but not against Blacks. The findings confirm discrimination's persistence and suggest that government messaging can address it in some settings, but more work is needed to understand the conditions under which such appeals are most effective.

To answer this question, we utilize elections to the Japanese House of Councillors as a natural experiment. Members are elected in national and local-level districts. To isolate the effect of name recognition on vote choice, we compare the vote shares of national district candidates in high name recognition prefectures—which we define as prefectures in which a national candidate shares the same surname as a local district candidate—and the other low name recognition prefectures. Our research design addresses internal and external validity problems from which previous studies suffer. We find that national candidates obtain 69% larger vote shares in high as opposed to low name recognition prefectures. This result holds when controlling for idiosyncratic characteristics of national candidates and prefecture-specific surname popularity.","Mere Exposure Effect, Recognition Heuristic, Election, Voting, Japan"

Finally, Big Five personality traits that have been dismissed as irrelevant to political ideology yield stronger and more consistent associations when larger batteries are employed. We also show that using high Cronbach's alpha and factor loadings as indicators of scale quality does not improve the criterion validity of brief measures.

I show that elections are an important determinant of governments’ actions against domestic terrorism. However, governments’ ideological orientation is essential to understanding the relationship between elections and counterterrorism. Using data from Western European democracies between 1950-2004, I show that as elections ap- proach, only right-oriented governments increase the volume of their counterterrorism activities.",

We offer an account of the downstream effects of issue frames on candidate choice. We then use three studies combining issue framing experiments with conjoint candidate choice experiments to directly assess these downstream effects. Despite an ideal setting for elite influence on public opinion, we find that frames ultimately have modest effects on how the public later evaluates politicians. Our theoretical framework highlights two sources of this disconnect. Frame-induced opinion change is only one component, often outweighed by other factors, in candidate choice and the issues most amenable to framing are the least relevant for evaluating candidates. This introduces a new consideration into debates about the political consequences of issue frames. Even after they change the public’s policy opinions, issue frames may still have limited implications for other political outcomes. (2017-09-28)","Political Communication, Issue Frames"

These counterintuitive results arise from a paradox whereby polarized politicians can best represent constituencies comprised of citizens with idiosyncratic preferences. We document this paradox among U.S. House Members, often criticized for excessive polarization. We show that if House Members represented their constituencies' preferences as closely as possible, they would still appear polarized. Moreover, current Members nearly always represent their constituencies better than counterfactual less-polarized Members. A series of experiments confirms that even ``moderate'' citizens usually prefer ostensibly polarized representatives to many less-polarized alternatives. (2017-09-26)",

People who agree to participate in opinion surveys are more informed, involved and opinionated about the political process and therefore hold stronger, more meaningful, and partisan political attitudes. This motivational discrepancy generates a bias in survey research that may amplify evidence of party polarization in the mass public. We test the association between response rates and measures of polarization using individual-level data from Pew surveys from 2004 to 2014 and American National Elections Studies from 1984 to 2012. Our empirical evidence demonstrates a significant decline in unit response that is associated with an increase in the percent of politically active, partisan, and polarized individuals in these surveys. This produces evidence of dissensus that, on some issues, may be stronger than exists in reality. (2017-09-18)","survey non-response, survey bias, public opinion, polarization, political engagement"

Whereas extent research emphasizes ethnocentrism’s influence on individual attitudes, we show that ethnocentrism directly contributes to economic decline by reducing greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI). We exploit greenfield FDI’s popularity to isolate ethnocentrism’s effects on economic activity. Our analysis of US state greenfield FDI flows during 2004-2012 holds constant country-level factors that correlate with both ethnocentrism and propensity to receive FDI. A one standard deviation increase in state-level ethnocentrism corresponds to nearly $229 million less greenfield FDI and 180 fewer jobs per state-year on average. Findings are robust to controls for state economic conditions, transactions costs, existing FDI stock, size of foreign-born population, and state partisanship. These findings demonstrate the economic cost of ethnocentrism-based political strategies and that mass political sentiment can directly undermine economic integration.",

I show this shift is being driven by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is the process of ideological sorting. The Democratic Party has lost support among conservative whites because the relationships between partisanship, voting behavior, and policy orientations have strengthened. The second mechanism relates to demographic changes. The growth of liberal minority populations has shifted the median position on economic issues to the left and away from the median white citizen’s position. The parties have responded to these changes by shifting their positions and whites have become less likely to support the Democratic Party as a result. I test these explanations using 40 years of ANES and DW-NOMINATE data. I find that whites have become 7.7-points more likely vote for the Republican Party and mean white partisanship has shifted .25 points in favor of the Republicans as a combined result of both mechanisms.

These files contain all original data in an excel file and the necessary Stata .do files to build and analyze the data used in the paper. ABSTRACT: A longstanding puzzle in American political development is why Western states extended voting rights to women before states in the East. Building on theories of democratization and women's suffrage, I argue that politicians have incentives to seek out new voters in competitive political environments. A strong suffrage movement reinforces these incentives by providing information and infrastructure that parties can capitalize on in future elections. If politicians believe they can mobilize the latent female vote, then large movements and competitive political environments should produce franchise expansion. Using data on legislative decisions pertaining to suffrage in 45 states from 1893 to 1920, I show that political competition and movement strength are robust predictors of support for women's suffrage in state legislatures. In the West, fluid partisan politics and relatively strong mobilization produced early reform. Since states determine who voted for national, state, and local offices, these decisions mattered for advancing political equality.

I focus on the relationship between the political context—namely, political advantage and disadvantage derived from elections—and media demand in the form of partisan newspaper circulations. Using a dataset that characterizes the partisan slant of local newspapers and their circulation levels between 1932 and 2004, I find that when parties are electorally advantaged in presidential contests, demand for their affiliated newspapers decreases relative to demand for papers affiliated with disadvantaged parties. I uncover evidence of similar patterns in a case study of Florida newspapers, and I also compare the power of presidential versus congressional outcomes in shaping feelings of advantage and disadvantage. Taken together, these results provide evidence of a negative link between political advantage derived from presidential elections and the relative demand for partisan news.",partisan media; elections; news demand

Abstract: Do public officials respond unequally to requests for career advice? Through a correspondence experiment with 8,189 officials, we examine whether (hypothetical) male and female students who express interest in political careers receive differential responses from public officials. We report three striking findings. First, emails sent by female students were more likely to receive a response than those sent by male students, especially when the official was male. Second, the responses women received were as likely to be long, thoughtful, and contain an offer of help as those to men. Third, there were no partisan differences in responsiveness to male or female senders. Examining senders with Hispanic last names bolsters the results: Hispanic senders, especially men, were less likely to receive a quality response than non-Hispanic senders. Thus politicians may condition responsiveness and helpfulness on the ethnicity of constituents, but women who are self-starters in search of advice receive equal treatment.

Yet even where state forces are losing, polling shows consistently strong support for counterinsurgents. How can we explain this discrepancy? Dominant theories of counterinsurgency could be incorrect, or, as we posit, individuals systematically may falsify their reported preferences. This study builds on the intuition that individuals may feel pressure to report consistently strong support for the military when asked directly, perhaps especially when they rely on an illegal organization or economy. We argue that this pressure decreases when individuals are asked indirectly, in a way that allows them to conceal their response. To assess, we randomize whether support for the military is measured directly and indirectly in a survey experiment in Colombia. We find lower rates of support with the indirect measure, and the difference is most pronounced in areas of insurgent control.""

We identify the presence of an alternative election-related distortion of government budgets---a drop in capital expenditures---that applies in low capacity and weak governance settings. In election years, the increase in scrutiny and distraction of politicians and bureaucrats decreases the ability of governments to facilitate complicated capital investments. We test this argument by exploiting the exogenous phasing-in and timing of local direct elections in Indonesian districts and detailed data on local budget compositions to document the existence of meaningful reductions in capital expenditures in election years. This effect is mediated by the status of incumbents. While safe incumbents who are running for re-election can avoid this particular type of distortion, elections with embattled incumbents or without incumbents running for re-election exhibit much stronger effects.

Here, we expand this argument, and show that pre-election coalition signals also have the potential to influence voter perceptions of the parties themselves. By revealing their coalition preferences, parties provide information on where they stand on the political continuum. We test our argument using a survey experiment run during a regional election campaign in Spain in which we manipulated the coalition signals emitted by two parties: one, a traditional, social-democratic party and, the second, a new, liberal party. Results show how coalition signals can significantly influence the party’s position and, ultimately, affect voters’ stated probability of voting, especially in the case of the recently founded party.

Replication Data for: Dividing the Dollar with Formulas,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6SRL9X,"May 24, 2017","In advanced democracies, most government spending is allocated according to criteria approved by a legislature but implemented by the bureaucracy. I ask whether this fact imposes a binding constraint on the ability of legislators to engage in targeted redistribution, by constructing a model in which legislators are constrained to allocate spending by a formula of limited dimension - in contrast to benchmark models where proposers have the flexibility to manipulate the payoffs of individual members directly. The model predicts over-sized winning coalitions, positive distributions outside of the winning coalition, and the emergence of persistent voting blocs. I then apply the model to a sample of 31 US federal spending bills, using new data connecting spending outcomes to authorizing legislation. I find that most allocation formulas for spending programs involve 5 or fewer factors. Formulaic allocation imposes a tight constraint on targeting, eliminating more than 90% of Congressional proposers' degrees of freedom. (2016)",

The results show a general trend toward ``U"" but with significant variation across countries and time, including cases with a reversal of this trend.",

When exogenous shocks make status quo policies less attractive, legislators become more tolerant to proposed alternatives, and the policy discretion of legislative agenda-setters increases. Given control of the EU agenda-setting process by pro-integration actors, we argue that this dynamic explains changes in voting patterns of the European Parliament during the crisis period. We observe voting coalitions increasingly dividing legislators along the pro-anti integration, rather than the left-right, dimension of disagreement, but only in policy areas related to the crisis. In line with more qualitative assessments of the content of passed legislation, the implication is that pro-integration actors were able to shift policy further towards integration than they could have without the crisis.

Governments can use redistributive taxes to combat inequality, but doing so requires public support. When will voters support redistributive taxes? Using the dual-process framework, we make predictions about the conditions under which party cues and/or information about rising inequality affect support for redistributive taxes. We test these predictions by conducting survey experiments in a real-world electoral context. We find that although citizens are misinformed about the extent of inequality, information that corrects their misperceptions helps them express tax policy opinions that are consistent with their preferences for lower levels of inequality. We also find that citizens who are motivated to process inequality information systematically respond to it even when it conflicts with their party’s position. These results identify conditions under which efforts to inform the electorate about inequality can increase support for taxes.

We study differences between contributions of the LPACs for leaders of both parties conditional on majority status. We find that both majority and minority party leaders prioritize winning elections and ideological homogeneity in their donations, but that these trends are largely contingent on overall electoral conditions. In their contributions, majority party leaders pay more attention to ideological cohesion than minority party leaders, while minority party leaders are more interested in gaining seats in the House than majority party leaders.

Using data from the United States, we provide evidence for this first hypothesis. Using multinational European data, we also provide support for a second hypothesis that this interaction would be more evident in “Westernized” contexts where the traditional left-right difference is clearly defined than in Eastern European countries where its meaning is less distinct; and we conceptually replicate the authoritarianism results using a measure of support for “conservation” values favoring security, conformity, and tradition. Together, these results suggest that the lower visibility of left-wing authoritarianism relative to its counterpart on the right may be due in part to greater withdrawal from politics among left-leaning authoritarians.","authoritarianism, values, ideology, political engagement"

However, the effect of these changes has received limited attention. We argue that the proportion of female representatives in a national legislature prolongs peace following a negotiated settlement. Moreover, we highlight two mechanisms through which greater female representation reduces the risk of conflict recurrence: 1) by prioritizing social welfare spending over military spending, and 2) by improving public perceptions of good governance and the credibility of political elites. We further argue that legislative independence and authority conditions this relationship, implying that greater female representation is more likely to promote peace in states with nominally democratic political institutions. Our empirical analyses of peace duration following negotiated settlements between 1946 and 2011 provide robust support for our general argument and the underlying mechanisms we believe drive this relationship.

We advance research on differences in susceptibility to framing effects by exploring whether, and how, physiological traits condition responses to messages in the political environment. In particular, we propose that the effectiveness of a frame depends on how well that frame’s argument matches the physiological predisposition or “outlook” of the recipient. We hypothesize that individuals who possess particular traits (we focus on physiological threat sensitivity) are more likely to be persuaded by frames that trigger those predispositions. To test this claim, we replicate and extend Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley’s (1997) landmark framing experiment about political tolerance in response to a Ku Klux Klan rally. We find that participants high in threat sensitivity are more susceptible to frames that invoke physical danger suggesting that physiological predispositions can help explain the influence of framing effects.","framing, threat sensitivity, political tolerance, physiological response, electrodermal activity"

Constructing measures for routinization and value infusion based on expert survey data, we test our framework through multivariate regression models across parties in 18 Latin American democracies. As theoretically expected, some conditions (access to executive office, a party’s formative environment and group ties) significantly relate to both dimensions, while others (party system polarization and fragmentation, permanent state subsidies, and legislative office) relate to one dimension only. This highlights the multidimensionality of party institutionalization as a phenomenon and the complexity of the empirical conditions associated with it.

While material self-interest is the base of most approaches to redistribution (first affecting preferences and then politics and policy), there is a paucity of research on inequality aversion. I propose that other-regarding concerns influence redistribution preferences and that: (1) they matter most to those in less material need and (2) they are conditional on the identity of the poor. Altruism is most relevant to the rich, and it is most influential when the recipients of benefits are similar to those financing them. Using data from the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2012, I will show that group homogeneity magnifies (or limits) the importance of altruism for the rich. In making these distinctions between the poor and the rich, the arguments in this paper challenge some influential approaches to inequality, immigration and voting.",

We embed an informational experiment about a U.S.-funded health project in a nationwide survey in Bangladesh. Although we find only limited recognition of the USAID brand, explicit information about U.S. funding slightly improves general perceptions of the United States; it does not, however, change respondent’s opinions on substantive foreign policy issues.

Such polarization is normatively troubling, as it exacerbates gridlock and dissensus in Washington. Given these negative consequences, I investigate whether it is possible to ameliorate this partisan discord. Building on the Common Ingroup Identity Model from social psychology, I show that by heightening subjects’ sense of American national identity, they comes to see members of the opposing party as fellow Americans, rather than rival partisans. As a result, they like the opposing party more, thereby reducing affective polarization. Using several original experiments, as well as a natural experiment surrounding the July 4th holiday and the 2008 Summer Olympics, I find strong support for my argument. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for efforts to reduce polarization more generally.

We use administrative data on voting and interactions with the criminal justice system from Pennsylvania to assess whether the association between incarceration and reduced voting is causal. Using administrative records that reduce the possibility of measurement error, we employ several different research designs to investigate the possibility that the observed negative correlation between incarceration and voting might result from differences across individuals that both lead to incarceration and low participation. As this selection bias issue is addressed, we find that the estimated effect of serving time in prison on voting falls dramatically and for some research designs vanishes entirely.

We detect the local economy’s impact with two unique datasets, one of which includes data on all consumer loans made in California and the other a census of businesses. In contrast to measures subject to sampling error, these population-based measures indicate that economic conditions at the zip code and county level have a substantial impact on presidential election outcomes. Presidents therefore face incentives to focus on electorally important geographic regions.

Replication Data for: Incremental Democracy: The Policy Effects of Partisan Control of State Government,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/14RSGX,"Nov 28, 2016","How much does it matter whether Democrats or Republicans control the government? Unless the two parties converge completely, election outcomes should have some impact on policy, but the existing evidence for policy effects of party control is surprisingly weak and inconsistent. We bring clarity to this question, using regression-discontinuity and dynamic panel analyses to estimate the effects of party control of state legislatures and governorships on a new annual measure of state policy liberalism. We find that throughout the 1936--2014 period, electing Democrats has led to more liberal policies, but that in recent decades the policy effects of party control have approximately doubled in magnitude. We present evidence that this increase is at least partially explained by the ideological divergence of the parties' officeholders and electoral coalitions. At the same time, we also show that party effects remain substantively modest, paling relative to policy differences across states.",

Replication Data for: The Role of the Information Environment in Partisan Voting,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOF11U,"Oct 31, 2016","Voters are often highly dependent on partisanship to structure their preferences toward political candidates and policy proposals. What conditions enable partisan cues to “dominate” public opinion? Here I theorize that variation in voters’ reliance on partisanship results, in part, from the opportunities their environment provides to learn about politics. A conjoint experiment and an observational study of voting in congressional elections both support the expectation that more detailed information environments reduce the role of partisanship in candidate choice. These findings clarify previously unexplained cross-study variation in party cue effects. They also challenge competing claims that partisan cues inhibit responsiveness to such a degree that voters fail to use other information or that high-information environments increase voter reliance on partisanship.",

We regard the competitiveness of MPs’ bids for renomination as a crucial indicator of the degree to which MPs are punished when deviating from their principals. Capitalizing on the opportunities offered by mixed-member electoral systems, we develop a theoretical account that makes the competitiveness of the candidate selection process conditional on the characteristics of the electoral system, the candidate selection regime, an MP’s parliamentary behavior, district characteristics and government status. Corroborating our expectations, the analysis of the candidate selection processes in the run-up to the 2013 Bundestag election shows that an increasing degree of ideological deviation from the party line—as expressed in parliamentary speeches—results in a worse position on the party list for opposition MPs, but does not affect the renomination chances of district candidates or of list candidates from the government camp.

"Droughts, Land Appropriation, and Rebel Violence in The Developing World",/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/WM6JE5,"Sep 27, 2016","Scholars note that rebel atrocities against civilians often arise within rural areas in the developing world. This characterization is not far-fetched, and recent data show that rebel atrocities do predominately occur within rural agricultural regions. Yet, the frequency of such incidents also varies substantially across different agricultural regions and years. What accounts for this observed variation in rebel-perpetrated atrocities against civilians within agricultural areas in developing countries? We develop a formal model to address this question, which contends that severe droughts can decrease food availability, prompting civilians to allocate food for immediate consumption and become increasingly willing to defend their diminishing supplies against rebels. This leads rebels to preempt the civilians' defensive efforts by committing atrocities, which forcibly separate civilians from their lands and food stockpiles. In empirically testing this hypothesis at the sub-national level across the developing world, we find robust support for our game-theoretic model's predictions. (2016-09-26)",

This study examines the effect of putschist-controlled broadcasting in the wake of Mali's 2012 coup and separatist insurgency. We leverage a field experiment of a radio (versus flashlight) distribution program in an area where citizens' only form of mass media is state-run radio. The putschists waged a campaign infused with nationalism to attempt to legitimize their rule. We find that, while radio exposure boosted national identity salience and willingness to delay elections, it did not elevate explicit approval for the junta---which suggests non-democratic regimes are less able to win approval using state broadcasting than previously thought, even while such broadcasting may affect citizens' attitudes and identity.

We describe a principled framework for testing such “elaborate” theories: nonparametric combination. NPC assesses the joint probability of observing the theoretically predicted pattern of results under the sharp null of no effects. NPC accounts for the dependence among the component tests without relying on modeling assumptions or asymptotic approximations. Multiple-testing corrections are also easily implemented with NPC. As we demonstrate with four applications, NPC leverages theoretical knowledge into greater statistical power, which is particularly valuable for studies with strong research designs but small sample sizes. We implement these methods in a new R package, NPC.",

Building on the finding of “class-biased economic voting” in the United States, we examine how OECD electorates respond to alternative distributions of income gains and losses. Drawing on individual-level electoral data and aggregate election results across 15 advanced democracies, we examine whether lower- and middle-income voters defend their distributive interests by punishing governments for concentrating income gains among the rich. We find no indication that non-rich voters punish rising inequality, and substantial evidence that electorates positively reward the concentration of aggregate income growth at the top. Our results suggest that governments commonly face political incentives systematically skewed in favor of inegalitarian economic outcomes. At the same time, we find that the electorate’s tolerance of rising inequality has its limits: class biases in economic voting diminish as the income shares of the rich grow in magnitude.

The goal of this study is to make sense of several existing, and at times conflicting, perspectives on how changes in inequality affect public preferences for government action by demonstrating that each of these perspectives can simultaneously coexist in a logical manner. The argument put forward here is that growing inequality systematically shapes preferences for redistribution in different ways depending on two important factors: economic context and the type of redistribution being considered. Using time-series cross-sectional data covering over three decades and all 50 states, the findings show that context does affect the degree of the public's response to inequality and support for action is stronger for particular types of redistributive policy.","income inequality, redistribution, state politics, public opinion, class politics"

The Role of Electoral Competitiveness and Party Size in Explaining Parties' Policy Shifts.""",/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/8XPBSA,"Jan 5, 2016","We provide data on a new measure of electoral competitiveness at the party level for parties that gained parliamentary representation in 11 countries from 1970 to 2014. The countries covered are Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The replication material contains all code necessary to compute the competitiveness measure as well as code to replicate all findings reported in the paper. The paper investigates how the degree of electoral competition affects parties' policy positions. It follows a growing body of research on party positioning in multi-party competition that regards elections as signals for parties that have to choose their positions and issue strategies. In this article we argue that previous elections provide information about the competitiveness of the upcoming election. The expected degree of electoral competition affects parties' future policy positions since with increasing competitiveness of an election, parties have higher incentives to move towards a vote-maximizing position. However, what constitutes a vote-maximizing strategy varies between parties. While large mainstream parties have an incentive to moderate their positions, small and niche parties choose more extreme positions to distinguish themselves from their mainstream competitors. Applying a novel measure of electoral competitiveness, we find that the degree of electoral competition, indeed, determines parties' policy shifts, but that this effect is moderated by party size.

As of yet, however, we lacked rigorous evidence that could inform this debate. As a contribution to address this shortcoming, we report spatial-econometric analyses of migrant inflows and the number of terrorist attacks in 145 countries between 1970 and 2000. The results suggest that migrants stemming from terrorist-prone states moving to another country are indeed an important vehicle through which terrorism does diffuse. Having said that, the findings also highlight that migrant inflows per se actually lead to a lower level of terrorist attacks. This research significantly improves our understanding of international and domestic terrorism, and has critical implications for the scholastic approach to terrorism as well as for countries' immigration policies worldwide.

While civil wars cluster and spread between states in international neighborhoods, ethnic groups within states consider their geography and location in choosing to foment rebellion. In answering why some ethnic groups turn to civil war, I unify and build on these ideas to develop a theory that ethnic civil wars follow patterns of contagion within states. I contend that ongoing conflicts in groups' geographic proximity provides increased logistic and strategic opportunity for successful rebellion. Using spatially-weighted regressions, I find evidence that ethnic civil wars are contagious within states and that such intrastate contagion is robust to other intra and interstate neighborhood effects that may alter groups' calculus of rebellion. These insights consistently demonstrate that accounting for groups' broader strategic surroundings yields important implications for the study of civil war.",

We offer a conceptual clarification of disgust’s potential connection to politics, arguing that individual differences in sensitivity to feeling disgusted inform public demand for policies designed to protect citizens from physical, moral, or imaginary contamination. We show that disgust sensitivity operates independently of political ideology and informs a wide array of protectionist policy preferences across the ideological spectrum, even controlling for other relevant predispositions. Our analyses suggest that disgust sensitivity is distinct from simple outgroup hostility, and the relationship between disgust sensitivity and opinion on policies regarding outgroups depends upon the content of those policies. Finally, survey experimental results suggest that political communication can activate disgust sensitivity in public opinion. (2015-10-14)","emotion, disgust, disgust sensitivity, public opinion"

Here I examine 65.3 million registration records from 10 states to trace individual-level participation before and after the 2012 round of redistricting, testing whether a shift in congressional representation, candidacy, and/or district ethnic composition impacted an individual's decision to participate. Separating results for non-Hispanic White, Black, Latino, and Asian registrants, I find that individuals change their behavior in response to ethnoracial context, with African Americans more likely to vote when assigned to majority-Black districts with Black candidates or incumbents. White and Asian registrants also turn out in higher numbers when a co-ethnic candidate is on the ballot, but Latinos may be less likely to vote in the short term when assigned to majority-Latino districts.","Voter Turnout, Race and Ethnicity, Redistricting, Majority-Minority Districts, Minority Candidates"

In four nationally representative surveys, we find low levels of support for unilateral powers, that these attitudes are stable over time, and that they are structured both by presidential approval and beliefs in the rule of law. In a fifth survey, we show that political context conditions support for unilateral power, and in a sixth we show that these attitudes are consequential for policy evaluation. Even during the Obama presidency, when presidential power is highly politicized, voters distinguish the president from the presidency. Our results have important implications for public opinion's role in constraining the use of presidential power. (2015-07-29)","public opinion, presidency, unilateral power"

This paper combines data from survey experiments, conducted on Georgian voters just weeks prior to the August 2008 war, with open-ended survey response questions from a survey fielded just weeks after the war. Respondents evaluated their leader's crisis behavior in the aftermath of a real war differently than the evidence from pre-war survey experiments would have suggested. The divergence in findings is demonstrated by providing evidence of three empirical phenomena: a ``Rally 'Round The Flag"" effect, a ``Fog Of War"" effect, and systematic differences in evaluations of leader performance depending on respondents' proximity to actual violence.","War Initiation, Costly Signals, Public Opinion, Survey Experiments, Georgia"

Policymakers argue that sanctions can deter state sponsorship, but are counterproductive against hosts of transnational terrorists. However, recent cases indicate that governments are often uncertain if foreign states are truly sponsors versus hosts, and cannot perfectly determine the type of foreign support terrorists are receiving. We argue that this uncertainty, coupled with the proposed strategy of punishing sponsors while cooperating with hosts, creates incentives for sponsors to misrepresent themselves as host states while continuing their support for terrorists. Using a game theoretic model, we demonstrate that in this environment of uncertainty, governments rely on information regarding the state capacity of supporting states to deduce their relationship with terrorists. Consequently, governments are more likely to impose sanctions against foreign states with intermediate levels of state capacity, but are less likely to impose sanctions against failing or stronger states. Our empirical test using the Threat and Imposition of Sanctions (TIES) dataset and the Global Terrorism Data (GTD) provides robust support for this hypothesis.

Politicians with college degrees do not tend to govern over more prosperous nations, do not pass more bills, do not tend to do better at the polls, and are no less likely to be corrupt.

Replication Data for: How Legislators Respond To Localized Economic Shocks: Evidence From Chinese Import Competition,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PAKFM8,"Apr 30, 2015","We explore the effects of localized economic shocks from trade on roll-call behavior and electoral outcomes in the U.S. House, 1990--2010. We demonstrate that economic shocks from Chinese import competition---first studied by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013)---cause legislators to vote in the more protectionist direction on trade bills but cause no change in their voting on all other bills. At the same time, these shocks have no effect on the reelection rates of incumbents, the probability an incumbent faces a primary challenge, or the partisan control of the district. Though changes in economic conditions are likely to cause electoral turnover in many cases, incumbents exposed to negative economic shocks from trade appear able to fend off these effects in equilibrium by taking strategic positions on foreign-trade bills. In line with this view, we find that the effect on roll-call voting is strongest in districts where incumbents are most threatened, electorally. Taken together, these results paint a picture of responsive incumbents who tailor their roll-call positions on trade bills to the economic conditions in their districts.","congress, roll-call voting, trade policy, representation, elections"
Replication Data for: Careful Commitments: Democratic States and Alliance Design,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DGHX1E,"Apr 22, 2015","Evidence suggests that leaders of democratic states experience high costs from violating past commitments. We argue that because democratic leaders foresee the costs of violation, they are careful to design agreements they expect to have a high probability of fulfilling. This may cause democratic leaders to prefer flexible or limited commitments. We evaluate our argument by analyzing the design of alliance treaties signed by countries of the world between 1815 and 2003. We find that alliances formed among democratic states are more likely to include obligations for future consultation rather than precommitting leaders to active conflict, and defense pacts formed among democratic states are more likely to specify limits to the conditions under which member states must join their partners in conflict. This research suggests that separating screening effects and constraining effects of international agreements is even more difficult than previously believed. States with the greatest likelihood of being constrained are more carefully screened. (2015-04-22)","Alliance, Democracy, Treaty, Commitment, International Agreement, International Cooperation"

Coethnic Bias and Wartime Informing,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/29314,"Mar 5, 2015","Information about insurgent groups is a central resource in civil wars: counterinsurgets seek it, insurgents safeguard it, and civilians often trade it. Yet despite its essential role in civil war dynamics, the act of informing is still poorly understood, due mostly to the classified nature of informant ""tips"" and the absence of reliable data on civilian attitudes. We use a 2,700 respondent survey experiment in 100 villages to examine attitudes toward the Guardians of Peace program, a widespread campaign by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan to recruit local informants. We find that coethnic bias - the systematic tendency to favor cooperation with coethnics - shapes attitudes about informing and beliefs about retaliation, especially among Tajik respondents. This bias persists even after adjusting for additional explanations and potential confounding variables, suggesting that identity considerations such as coethnicity influence attitudes toward a high-risk behavior in wartime settings.

Bargaining Power in the Supreme Court: Evidence from Opinion Assignment and Vote Switching,/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/29205,"Feb 22, 2015","How can we assess relative bargaining power within the Supreme Court? Justices cast two votes in every case, one during the initial conference and one on the final merits of the case. Between these two votes, a justice is assigned to draft the majority opinion. We argue that vote switching can be used to detect the power of opinion authors over opinion content. Bargaining models make different predictions for opinion content and therefore for when other justices in the initial majority should be more or less likely to defect from initial positions. We derive hypotheses for how opinion authorship should affect vote switching and find that authorship has striking effects on switching. Authors thus have disproportionate influence and by extension so do Chief Justices, who make most assignments. This evidence is compatible with only the âAuthor Influenceâ class of bargaining models, with particular support for one model within this class. This contains vote switch data and coalition level data. (2015)",
