*   Selected settings for variables with multiple output options:
*        Distance variable measured using capitol coordinates and land contiguity, including modifications from The War Trap
*        Peace years calculated using Werner peace year adjustment
*       Dispute characteristics:
*        When two or more disputes occur in a year, data is from the highest intensity dispute
*        Disputes marked for originators only
*        All dyad-years with an ongoing MID dropped
*        Ongoing dispute years not considered new initiations
*        Joiner Dyads included
