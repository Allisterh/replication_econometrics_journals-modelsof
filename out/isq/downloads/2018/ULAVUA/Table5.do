* Note that table 5 is created by directly reading the coefficients from Table 4   *
* For example, the first row of Table 5 indicates that in the context of rivalry   *
* and territory, moving from non-joint democracy to joint democracy produces a     *
* hazard ratio of 1.05 and it is insignificant.  This coefficient value is found   *
* by going to Table 4, Model 5.  The omitted category in this model is             *
* MixedRegime*Territy*Rivalry.  The coefficient on JointDemocracy*Territory*Rivalry*
* JointDemocracy*Territory*Rivalry captures the effect of moving from a mixed dyad *
* to joint democracy while holding Territory and Rivalry constant.                  *
