*************
* This do-file generates a Stata dataset of S measures from EUGene.


* Set up Stata

* The next command drops the case that was read if the user included a line of variable names
drop if missing(ccode1) | missing(year)

* Interpret missing values

label variable year "Year of observation"
label variable cap_1 "National Capabilities Index (CINC) for cc1"
